# Discrete-Optimization


Discrete optimization or combinatorial optimization means searching for an optimal solution in a finite or countably infinite set of potential solutions.

In discreve optmization the set D is a discrete, countable set. In constrast to continuous sets and continuous functions

Definition:

Solution x* ∈ S is an optimum solution of (OPT) if f(x*) <= f(x) for all x ∈ S.

In the maximization case the inequality is reversed.

SOLUTION METHODS

* EXACT METHODS
  - Are guaranteed to find the optimal solution in finite computational time.
* HEURISTIC METHODS
  - Have no guarantee for optimatily but they are based on reason-able. Theses methods are easy to implement and efficient.
  
  WHEN HEURISTIC ARE PREFERRED OVER EXACT METHODS 
  
 * The problem is so large or high dimensional that the exact methods might take so long
 * The exact methods - if they exists - require the problem to be coded in a format that is too complicated, extensive or time consuming
 * No codes are available for exact algorithms, programming would be too tedious, time consuming, expensive
 * A feasible and functional solution is needed quickly
 * Problem data is urcentain, innacurate or fuzzy -> exact solution isn't of much worth
